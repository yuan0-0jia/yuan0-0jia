- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yuan
- Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.
- Some of the courses I've taken include
    - Software Engineering Project, Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms, Network Programming, Embedded System Design.
- When I'm free, I enjoy exploring Santa Cruz through my camera lens. You can often find me wandering around Santa Cruz with my Nikon F3.
